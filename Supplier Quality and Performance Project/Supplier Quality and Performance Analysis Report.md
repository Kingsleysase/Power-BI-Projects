## Project Overview & Methodology

### Project Scope

I developed a comprehensive Supplier Quality and Performance Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to analyze quality metrics across our entire supply chain ecosystem. This project examined 2.6 billion defects, 215,810 downtime hours, and $2.16 million in monthly downtime costs to identify critical quality improvement opportunities.

### Technical Approach

**Platform**: Microsoft Power BI Desktop  
**Data Scale**: Multi-billion defect records across vendors, plants, materials, and time dimensions  
**Analysis Framework**: 5 core performance dimensions with risk categorization and trend analysis

### Methodology

I implemented a comprehensive quality intelligence framework analyzing:
- **Vendor Performance**: Risk segmentation, defect volumes, and cost impact assessment  
- **Plant Operations**: Geographic quality variations and facility-specific performance patterns  
- **Material Analysis**: Category-wise quality trends and defect type classification  
- **Temporal Patterns**: Monthly, daily, and seasonal quality variations  
- **Financial Impact**: Downtime cost analysis and ROI implications

## Data Analysis & Key Discoveries

### Supply Chain Quality Landscape

Through my analysis, I uncovered the scale and complexity of our quality challenges:
- **Total Defects**: 2.6 billion quality incidents across all suppliers  
- **Downtime Impact**: 215,810 hours of production interruption  
- **Financial Cost**: $2.16 million monthly downtime expenses  
- **Year-over-Year Growth**: Alarming 123.45% increase in downtime costs

### Vendor Performance Segmentation

I categorized suppliers into three distinct risk profiles:

**High-Risk Vendors** (Premium Cost Impact):  
- **Downtime Cost Range**: $8,000–$12,000 per incident  
- **Defect Volume**: 10–15 million defects per vendor  
- **Top Performers**: Yombu (15.1M), Avamm (14.7M), Meejo (14.2M)

**Medium-Risk Vendors** (Moderate Impact):  
- **Cost Range**: $4,000–$8,000 per incident  
- **Volume Range**: 5–15 million defects  
- **Characteristics**: Manageable with targeted interventions

**Low-Risk Vendors** (Minimal Impact):  
- **Cost Range**: Under $4,000 per incident  
- **Volume Range**: Sub-8 million defects  
- **Status**: Benchmark performance levels for improvement targets

### Geographic Performance Variations

My plant-level analysis revealed significant quality disparities:
- **Hingham**: 100M defects — highest absolute volume  
- **Charles City**: 99M defects — consistently problematic  
- **Twin Rocks**: 97M defects — third-highest risk facility  
- **Performance Gap**: 6M defect difference between best and worst facilities

## Critical Insights & Business Impact

### The Certification Crisis

**"Not Certified"** defects represent our single largest quality category at 152 million incidents, indicating fundamental gaps in:
- Incoming inspection processes  
- Supplier qualification  
- Quality gate enforcement  

**Business Impact**: Production disruption, compliance risk, and credibility loss.

### Material Category Risk Assessment

- **Raw Materials**: 0.77 billion defects — highest risk  
- **Corrugate**: 0.62 billion — packaging vulnerabilities  
- **Mechanicals**: 0.82 billion — critical part failures  
- **Logistics**: 0.70 billion — issues in transit and delivery  

### Temporal Quality Patterns

**Monthly Peaks**:
- **October**: $292K downtime costs  
- **September**: $217K  
- **March**: $235K  

**Weekly Hotspots**:
- **Wednesday**: $411K — highest risk day  
- **Monday**: $394K  
- **Friday**: $262K — relative improvement  

### The Impact Classification Paradox

- **No Impact**: 39.86% — deceptive “low risk” but high resource drain  
- **Direct Impact**: 31.71% — causes real-time disruptions  
- **Rejected**: 28.43% — results in full production loss

## Recommendations & Strategic Roadmap

### Immediate Crisis Response (0–3 Months)

**1. Vendor Emergency Intervention Program**  
- Audit and retrain Yombu, Avamm, Meejo  
- Goal: 25% defect reduction in 90 days  
- Deploy supplier quality engineers  

**2. Certification Process Overhaul**  
- Reinforce quality gate controls  
- Use automated verification systems  
- Target: Eradicate 152M “Not Certified” incidents  

**3. Plant-Specific Campaigns**  
- Focus on Hingham, Charles City, Twin Rocks  
- Deploy standardized processes and RCA frameworks  

### Strategic Quality Transformation (3–12 Months)

**4. Predictive Quality Analytics**  
- Use ML models for defect risk scoring  
- Catch quality issues before they escalate  

**5. Supplier Risk Diversification**  
- Qualify new vendors  
- Reduce overdependence on the top 3  

**6. Material Category Excellence**  
- Corrugate & Mechanicals: Launch improvement programs  
- Share best practices across categories  

### Long-Term Supply Chain Intelligence (12+ Months)

**7. Integrated Quality Ecosystem**  
- IoT-based monitoring at key supply points  
- Real-time dashboards and automated alerts  
- Partner with suppliers on continuous improvement

**Expected Outcomes**:
- 40% drop in downtime costs  
- 50% cut in critical defect categories  
- 15% boost in equipment uptime  
- 80% of vendors reclassified as low-risk
