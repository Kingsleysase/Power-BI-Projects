## Project Overview & Methodology

### Project Scope

I developed a comprehensive HR Attrition Dashboard using Power BI to analyze employee turnover patterns across a workforce of 2,925 employees. This project aimed to identify critical factors driving the organization's 16.17% attrition rate and provide data-driven recommendations for talent retention.

### Technical Approach

**Platform**: Microsoft Power BI Desktop  
**Data Volume**: 2,925 employee records with comprehensive demographic and professional attributes  
**Analysis Dimensions**: 9 key factors including demographics, job characteristics, and satisfaction metrics

### Methodology

I employed a multi-dimensional analytical framework examining:
- **Demographic Analysis**: Age bands, gender, marital status, education levels  
- **Professional Factors**: Departments, job roles, business travel patterns, tenure  
- **Geographic Considerations**: Distance from home and its impact on retention  
- **Satisfaction Metrics**: Job satisfaction levels across departing vs. current employees

## Data Analysis & Key Discoveries

### Employee Composition Insights

Through my analysis, I discovered that our organization maintains a diverse workforce with current employees showing:
- **Gender Distribution**: 59.3% male, 40.7% female  
- **Age Concentration**: 35–44 age group dominates the current workforce (905 employees)  
- **Educational Profile**: Bachelor's degree holders represent the largest segment (942 current employees)  
- **Departmental Structure**: R&D leads with 1,642 employees, followed by Sales (708) and HR (102)

### Attrition Pattern Analysis

I identified several critical patterns in employee departures:

**Demographic Concentrations**:
- Ages 25–34 show the highest departure rates (223 employees)  
- Male employees disproportionately represented in departures (63.42%)  
- Bachelor's degree holders lead departures (199 employees)  
- Single employees show the highest attrition rate (50.11%)

**Professional Risk Factors**:
- R&D department experiences the highest absolute losses (264 departures)  
- Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives show the highest role-specific attrition  
- Entry-level and intern positions demonstrate concerning turnover rates  
- Employees traveling rarely constitute the largest departure group (311 employees)

### Geographic Impact Discovery

My distance-from-home analysis revealed a surprising pattern: employees living 18–25 km from the office show elevated departure rates, suggesting an optimal commute threshold beyond which retention becomes challenging.

## Critical Insights & Business Impact

### The Mid-Career Talent Drain

Employees in their prime productive years (25–44) represent 68% of all departures. These individuals typically bring:
- Peak performance capabilities  
- Leadership potential  
- Institutional knowledge accumulation  
- Innovation and growth mindset  

**Business Impact**: Loss of future leadership pipeline and reduced innovation capacity.

### Department-Specific Risk Assessment

R&D and Sales departments, while representing our core value creation, show disproportionate attrition:
- **R&D Impact**: Loss of specialized technical knowledge and ongoing research continuity  
- **Sales Impact**: Client relationship disruption and revenue pipeline risks  
- **Combined Effect**: 95% of total attrition concentrated in business-critical functions

### The Satisfaction Paradox

30.44% of departing employees reported being satisfied with their jobs. This suggests:
- Job satisfaction alone is insufficient for retention  
- Unmet growth expectations drive departures  
- Career development gaps are more critical than immediate job contentment

### Gender-Specific Retention Challenges

The disproportionate male attrition rate (63.42%) versus 59.3% workforce representation indicates:
- Potential gender-specific workplace experience gaps  
- Different career advancement perceptions  
- Need for demographic-targeted retention strategies
